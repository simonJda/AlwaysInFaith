        <div class="AMmainChild1">
            <p><b>In the summer of 2025, the Lord placed it on my heart to start a blog. And here we are.</b>
            <br>
            I’m so excited to share with you what God is doing in my life and heart. The season Jesus is leading me through is one of restoration and the renewing of the mind. This blog is meant to give you a glimpse into how I’m walking through this season—and how to live as a disciple of Jesus and a daughter of God.</p>
            <p>The name is a pun between <i>Always in Faith</i> and <i>A-L’s Ways in Faith</i>. My desire is to encourage you by showing <i>my</i> ways in faith so that you can remain always in faith. Regardless of what life, the devil, or others may bring your way.</p>
            <p>But first, let me tell you a bit more about myself.</p>
            <p>I’m a 21-year-old student at Awakening School of Ministry (School Year 2025/26). I’m Dutch and lived in the Netherlands my whole life, until last year. My favorite animals are pigs, and just like a little girl, you can always make me smile by showing me a photo or video of one.<br>I love spending time with friends, visiting beautiful places, and seeking adventure. One of my favorite things to do is travel and explore nature, especially the (Swiss) mountains. Thank God He called me to live in Germany, just ten minutes from the Swiss border!</p>
            <p>But my life hasn’t always been this close to God. In fact, until I was 18 or 19, I didn’t want much to do with Him or the Christian faith. Most of my life, I actually felt resistant towards it.</p>
            <p>I grew up in a christian family, parents, two sisters and a brother. We were part of a religious church in our village and (almost) never missed a Sunday.<br>Growing up in that church environment meant growing up with a lot of rules and traditions, espacially when I saw the lifestyle of my classmates and their families, <br> compared to mine. So maybe I didn't struggle with God so much, but struggled more with the traditions and rules that were placed around Him. That’s why, for most of my life, I wasn’t really interested in getting to know Him, let alone living with Him.</p>
            <p>Until 2023.<br>He entered my life in a way I never expected. That year, I was struggling with a deep depression. My life felt worthless and empty.<br>Very long story short, I spontaneously decided to get baptized after realizing my life was heading in the wrong direction, and I figured it was worth taking one step toward God to see what would happen</p>
            <p>And something <b>did</b> happen.</p>
            <p>The next morning, I woke up completely different than any morning ever before. I woke up happy, with a heart full of joy, peace, and hope, something I had never felt so strongly.<br>The heaviness and pain in my heart were completely gone…</p>
            <p>Over the next two years, after that first encounter with God, He took me on a journey of getting to know Him, discovering my new identity in Christ, and walking as a disciple of Jesus.</p>
            <p> I moved to Germany to attend the Awakening School of Ministry, and apart from my baptism, it was the most transformative year of my life.</p>
            <p>I saw God and His glory in new ways. He brought me deeper into both His identity and mine. And now, I am forever His.<br>The Lord set me free from so many things that year and began a process of restoration in my heart. That process continued over the summer after I finished the school program, and during that summer, I heard the call of God:</p>
            <p><i>“Anne, I want you to do the school again.”</i></p>
            <p>So, here I am.<br>Still living in Germany. Still attending the Awakening School of Ministry (ASM), now for the second time. And now sharing glimpses of my walk with God through these blogs. <br>God and his glory are transforming my life and I am so excited to share glimpses of it with you. I hope you will be deeply impacted by God through what you read on this site.<br>It's not about me, but it's about you meeting Him on these pages.</p>
            <p>Awakening School of Ministry is a nine-month program created to equip and empower a new generation of Jesus-loving leaders. Based in Eimeldingen, Germany, and part of the larger movement of Awakening Europe, the school focuses on helping students deepen their relationship with God and confidently walk in their unique calling. At its core, ASM is about living in God’s presence, growing in biblical understanding, and gaining practical experience in ministry.</p>
